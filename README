Mystery Maze by iris
A small project for the Recurse Center application, June 2025

Inspired by an activity described in the book
"Right Kind of Wrong" by Amy Edmondson
 
# Short Description:
Small, terminal-based game built on python.
The goal of the game is for the user to find their way 
through a maze from entry to exit as quickly as possible. 

# The Game:
- The maze exists within a grid of tiles.
- Path tiles are part of the maze.
- Wall tiles are not.
- There is an Entry tile and an Exit tile.
- Except for the Entry, all tiles are at first shrouded, 
  and the user must step on a tile before revealing if
  it's a path tile or wall tile.
- The user can only step on tiles neighboring already 
  revealed path tiles. 
- The user takes steps using the arrow keys.
- Stepping on a path tile is a success.
- Stepping on a wall tile is a failure.
- Some path tiles lead to dead ends.
- The game is over and the user wins when they
  reveal the Exit tile.

There is no losing, only taking longer.
