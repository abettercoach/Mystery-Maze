Mystery Maze by iris
A small project for the Recurse Center application, June 2025

Inspired by an activity described in the book
"Right Kind of Wrong" by Amy Edmondson
 
# Description:
Small, terminal-based game built on python.
The goal of the game is for the user to find their way 
through a maze from entry to exit as quickly as possible. 

- The object of the game is to make your way through the maze.
- The maze is enconded as grid of tiles.
- Some tiles are part of the maze path.
- The rest are wall tiles.
- There is an entry tile and an exit tile.
- Except for the entry, all tiles are at first shrouded.
- The user moves with the arrow keys.
- With each move, the user must steps on a tile before
  revealing if it's a path tile or wall tile.
- The user can only step on tiles neighboring already 
  revealed path tiles. 
- The user moves position if stepped on a path tile.
- Stepping on a path tile is a success.
- Stepping on a wall tile is a failure.
- Some path tiles lead to dead ends.
- The game is over and the user wins when they
  reveal the Exit tile.

There is no losing, only taking longer.

# Caution & Troubleshooting
The game will crash if the terminal window is 
too small (too short) to display the text and maze.

If you get this error:
`_curses.error: addwstr() returned ERR`

Please make your terminal window larger and try 
running the program again.

Resolving this issue is not currently in scope 
for this project.
